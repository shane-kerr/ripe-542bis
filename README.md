RIPE Working Group Chairs 

Document ID:ripe-xxx

Date: 2016-11-28
 
## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe the role,
responsibilities, and expectations associated with RIPE Working
Group (WG) Chairs.

The document is divided into the following sections: 

* WG chairs and co-chairs
* Creating WG charters
* Updating WG charters
* Policy Development Process (PDP) responsibilities
* RIPE Meeting responsibilities


## 2. Working Group Chairs and Co-Chairs

RIPE working groups operate under a co-chair model. In this, the
co-chairs share the responsibility for all tasks involved in chairing
their working group.  The co-chairs act together to make any formal
statements (for example on policy development) that are relevant
to their WG.

A WG has either 2 or 3 co-chairs.

When participating in RIPE discussions, WG chairs and co-chairs should
endeavour to make it clear whether they speak on behalf of themselves,
the organisations they work for, or the WG for which they are
co-chair.


## 3. Creating Working Group Charters

### i) Working Group created from a Task Force

A WG usually emerges from a Task Force. In this case, the procedure
for creating the WG Charter is as follows:

The head of the Task Force creates the charter for the new WG in
consultation with other members of the Task Force. Once this has been
agreed, and approved by the RIPE Chair, the charter for the new WG is
officially recognised.

### ii) New Working Group Emerging from an Existing WG

If a new WG emerges from an existing WG, then the chairs and co-chairs
of both the new and existing WG should draw up the charter for the new
WG. Once this has been agreed, and approved by the RIPE Chair, the
charter for the new WG is officially recognised.

## 4. Updating Working Group Charters

If a WG Chair needs to update the WG charter, they must have the text
approved by the WG co-chairs before presenting the revised charter to
the WG for their approval via the WG mailing list. The RIPE Chair has
final approval of the new charter.

## 5. Policy Development Process (PDP) Responsibilities

WG Chairs are expected to: 

* Stay up-to-date with all phases of a policy proposal relevant to
  their WG
* Follow discussions on the relevant WG mailing list(s)
* Guide mailing list discussions as appropriate
* Take charge of PDP milestone decisions relevant to their WG
* Ensure PDP milestone decisions keep to the timeframe as described in
  the document **"Policy Development Process in RIPE" (ripe-642)**
* Inform the RIPE NCC when a policy proposal has received consensus
  and should become a RIPE Document

Note that these responsibilities are shared between the co-chairs.

## 6. RIPE Meeting Responsibilities

### i) General/Plenary

WG Chairs are expected to: 

* Attend RIPE Meetings or **ensure that a co-chair attends the
  meeting**

### ii) Working Group Specific

WG chairs are expected to: 

* Solicit relevant content for the WG session
* Post a draft agenda for their WG session (at least 2-3 weeks before
  a RIPE Meeting where possible)
* Lead the WG session and encourage active participation
* Review and approve the minutes from their WG session (4-6 weeks)
* Attend WG chair lunches during RIPE Meetings
* Attend WG chair meetings between RIPE Meetings
* Update the action list of their WG after the RIPE Meeting
* Approach the RIPE Chair with any requests to fund a speaker's
  attendance at a RIPE Meeting. If the request for funding is deemed
  appropriate by the RIPE Chair, the RIPE Chair will request funding
  from the RIPE NCC Managing Director. The RIPE NCC Managing Director
  may or may not approve such a request at their own discretion.

These responsibilities may be split between co-chairs.

## Changes since ripe-542

Minor:
* Changed to Oxford comma, because we love clarity.
* Converted to gender-neutral pronouns (they).
* Updated reference to RIPE PDP.
* Chairs get "content" not "presentations" for WG sessions.

Major:
* Eliminated the chair with optional co-chair model.
* Added RIPE Chair as final approval of new charters.
* Changed new charter approval only to mailing list (was "and/or at a
  RIPE Meeting").
* Noted that we no longer have the WG chair responsibility to act as
  final approval on all new policies (outside of their own WG).
* Removed responsibility to lead Plenary sessions, since the PC now
  does that.
* Removed references to the EOF Coordinator since that role does not
  really exist now.

Open questions:
* Do we still need "Attend WG chair meetings between RIPE Meetings"?
* Do we need to reference the RIPE PDP by number or just specify the
  RIPE PDP?
